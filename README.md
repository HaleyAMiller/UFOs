## UFO Sightings Overview
#### A data journalist is interested in publishing content related to her interests. For this project, she is looking to synthesize data relating to UFO sightings and utilize JavaScript to create a website to showcase the data in a HTML format. In an HTML format, she is then able to share data relating to UFO sightings with her followers and readers. The first step in her process was to create the index.HTML file to organize the layout of the website. Then she created functions within JavaScript to upload data from the file and build a table on the webpage to display the data in an easier to read format. Lastly, she included filters so that the visitors of this site can filter the UFO sightings based on date, city, state, country, and shape. The resulting HTML is interactive and visually pleasing thanks to her hard work and Bootstrap components.

## Resources Utilized
##### Data Source: data.js
##### Software: Visual Studio Code 1.65.0; JavaScript; Bootstrap

## Search Results
#### To successfully use the HTML, certain steps must be followed. Below the simple instructions and corresponding images on how to search for a userâ€™s desired data:
*	First, navigate to the correct HTML. The page designed includes the heading.

*	Then, scroll to the bottom of the page where the filter options and data table are listed.

*	The user must select at least one filter. In the example below, the search is being filtered by city.

*	The user may then select one or more of the other filters. In the example below, the search is being filtered by both city and shape.

## UFO Summary
One of the main drawbacks of this project is that it must be launched from an HTML document and cannot be easily accessed by a web search. To gain more visibility, the data journalist may want to learn ways to expand the reach of her webpage. Another drawback is that is does not save search results. For example, if a person completes a search but does not recall the search parameters, there is no way to save the search or go back to the original search criteria.

A way to make this project more successful could be to save search results for the users of the page. That way they can then easily access their searches while moving on to other searches. This could possibly be done using an event listener to record input from the users which could then be displayed back to them. Another opportunity for growth for this project would be to incorporate multiple pages so that users can access other information on other pages, such as UFO watch groups or possible UFO theories. One way for the page to also be improved could be to redirect users to other sources when they click on the data table.
